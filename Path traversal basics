Simplest approach is just manipulate parameter in GET request filename=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd, however if it doesnt work, it may be also bypassed using:
filename=....//....//....//....//....//....//....//....//....//....//..../etc/passwd, cause weak funkction that validates URL input may be just weak and remove only "../"
Sometimes you might be able to use an absolute path from the filesystem root, such as filename=/etc/passwd, to directly reference a file without using any traversal sequences.
