Simplest approach is just manipulate parameter in GET request filename=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd, however if it doesnt work, it may be also bypassed using:
filename=....//....//....//....//....//....//....//....//....//....//..../etc/passwd, cause weak funkction that validates URL input may be just weak and remove only "../"
Sometimes you might be able to use an absolute path from the filesystem root, such as filename=/etc/passwd, to directly reference a file without using any traversal sequences.

You might be able to use nested traversal sequences, such as ....// or ....\/. These revert to simple traversal sequences when the inner sequence is stripped.


#Double URL encoding
Another approach is to encode payload ../../../etc/passwd using URL encode in cyber chef. The result is %2E%2E%2F%2E%2E%2F%2E%2E%2Fetc%2Fpasswd or  encode it twice (or even more times) to get
%2E%2E%2F%2E%2E%2F%2E%2E%2Fetc%2Fpasswd

# Null byte
An application may require the user-supplied filename to end with an expected file extension, such as .png. 
In this case, it might be possible to use a null byte to effectively terminate the file path before the required extension. For example: filename=../../../etc/passwd%00.png.

GET /image?filename=../../../../../etc/passwd%00.png // works

## How to prevent a path traversal attack ?
The most effective way to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities is to avoid passing user-supplied input to filesystem APIs altogether. Many application functions that do this can be rewritten to deliver the same behavior in a safer way.

If you can't avoid passing user-supplied input to filesystem APIs, we recommend using two layers of defense to prevent attacks:

Validate the user input before processing it. Ideally, compare the user input with a whitelist of permitted values. If that isn't possible, verify that the input contains only permitted content, such as alphanumeric characters only.
After validating the supplied input, append the input to the base directory and use a platform filesystem API to canonicalize the path. Verify that the canonicalized path starts with the expected base directory.
Below is an example of some simple Java code to validate the canonical path of a file based on user input:

File file = new File(BASE_DIRECTORY, userInput);
if (file.getCanonicalPath().startsWith(BASE_DIRECTORY)) {
    // process file
}
